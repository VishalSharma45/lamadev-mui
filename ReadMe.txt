1. This is the my very first React Project.

2. In this Project we just learn file/folder structure of the React App.

3. We learn 
    1) import/export, 
    2) default export, 
    3) apply css and importing the css

4. We learn about Components, How Components import from one file to another file.

5. Bundle up/import all Components into single Component and export the one single Component.
